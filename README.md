My name is Nicole Combs. (Like honeycomb, but without the :bee:</g-emoji> .. ) I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer currently residing in the :sunny: state! I love sunflowers :sunflower: and building sandcastles :european_castle: on the beach. Front-end Development is my niche. I love seeing the colors and design POP on screen! I am currently with 100 Devs, but always looking for opportunities that will allow me to grow in my career.


ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her <br>
:coffee: I currently write in Javascript, but am growing in profeciency with Java. <br>
ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact: I'm the Ring-Master of a three-ring circus :circus_tent: each day. The show acts consist of: 4 children, 4 dogs, 1 cat, and a husband. I was born to flourish in pandemonium :sparkles:
